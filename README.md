# Hi, I'm Lisa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product designer, artist, maker currently creating net new 0-to-1 experiences at Meta's internal innovation lab, [New Product Experimentation](https://npe.fb.com/). My work is both intentional and whimsical, both design and code, both pixelated and hand-drawn.

In the past, I'ved designed trust, safety, and content moderation tools at Facebook, helped Dropbox retain customers on their growth team, and helped startups better meet their users where they're at. 

Outside of product design practice, I run [Daybreak Supply Co](https://www.daybreaksupply.co/) and have my own personal art and illustration practice.

One evening many years ago, I met an older gentleman at a coffee shop in Oakland while I was sketching and writing in my journal. He told me that with any idea or venture I had, the most important thing to do was to "concentrate".
