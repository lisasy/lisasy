# Hi, I'm Lisa ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently leading product design at [Forem](https://www.forem.com/), where we're creating open source software to empower creators & communities. Before that, I designed trust, safety, and content moderation tools at Facebook; freelanced with large companies and startups; and worked at thoughtbot. 

Outside of my product design practice, I'm a visual artist who draws & writes comics, and enjoys painting and sketching from life. Paintings, zines, sketchbooks, prints â€” I love all of it. Amongst a bajillion little creative projects I have going on in my sketchpads and my brain, I'm working on a graphic memoir about growing up in an working-class immigrant Asian family in LA.

One evening many years ago, I met an older gentleman at a coffee shop in Oakland while I was sketching and writing in my journal. He told me that with any idea or venture I had, the most important thing to do was to "concentrate".
